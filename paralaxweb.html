        <h2>NORTHERN LIGHTS</h2>
        <p>The northern lights, or the aurora borealis, are beautiful dancing waves of light that have captivated people for millennia. But for all its beauty, this spectacular light show is a rather violent event. 

            Energized particles from the sun slam into Earth's upper atmosphere at speeds of up to 45 million mph (72 million kph), but our planet's magnetic field protects us from the onslaught. 
            
            As Earth's magnetic field redirects the particles toward the poles — there are southern lights, too, the dramatic process transforms into a cinematic atmospheric phenomenon that dazzles and fascinates scientists and skywatchers alike.</p>

        <h2>BEST TIME TO EXPERIENCE THIS EFFECT</h2>
        <p>The Northern Lights flicker across Arctic skies throughout the year 
            but the best time to see them in Norway is from September to March, when it’s dark enough at night to see them.
             They sometimes appear in early spring, too.
            Within that window, the best time of day to see the Northern Lights is
             between 5pm and 2am – although Dr Mason says you might
              see the colours more easily at twilight.
               “That’s because the brightness of the background sky will trigger the colour sensors in your eye so 
               that when the Lights do appear, you can see the colour in them. When the sky gets really dark,
                you’ll find you can’t see the colour as well as 
                you did earlier on, unless the display becomes brighter. It’s all about how our eyes perceive this in the darkness.”
             Some aurora displays last for 
             just a few minutes, disappearing before reappearing minutes or hours later. Some last for 15 to 30 minutes. 
             If you’re really lucky, 
             you could be wowed for a couple of hours or more.</p>
